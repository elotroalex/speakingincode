<p class="introduction"><strong>Speaking in Code</strong> will be an <a href="http://www.neh.gov/divisions/odh">NEH-supported</a> summit for digital humanities software developers, dedicated to voicing the things we tacitly embody in our platforms and tools: expert knowledge about the intellectual work of code-craft and unspoken understandings about its relation to scholarly method and humanities theory. In the coming academic year, the <a href="http://scholarslab.org">Scholars' Lab</a> will help the DH developers' community devise concrete, pragmatic initiatives to address the following question&mdash;in its own terms: "How can we bring technical conversations that may strike humanities scholars as too informal, inaccessible, or telegraphic into more open, inclusive discourse?"</p>
